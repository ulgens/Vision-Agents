# Golf Swing Coaching Guide

## 1. Introduction
A golf coach’s primary responsibility when teaching the swing is to build a foundation of solid fundamentals while recognizing and correcting common faults. Every player is unique, but by consistently monitoring a few key elements—grip, stance, posture, plane, tempo, and balance—coaches can guide students toward repeatable, efficient swings. The following guidelines break down the swing into phases, with clear teaching points and coaching cues.

## 2. Grip
The grip is the player’s only connection to the club, so it deserves constant attention. Coaches should ensure the grip sits in the fingers, not the palms, and that both hands work together without excess tension. Too tight a grip creates stiffness and an open face at impact; too loose a grip risks loss of control. Encourage students to find a neutral hand position where they can see two to three knuckles on the lead hand.

## 3. Stance and Posture
Before the club moves, setup determines the quality of the swing. A shoulder-width stance with slightly flexed knees and the spine tilted from the hips creates an athletic base. Coaches should watch for slouching, excessive knee bend, or flat-footed balance. Weight should lean slightly forward toward the lead side, setting the stage for a proper weight transfer.

## 4. Alignment and Ball Position
Alignment errors often mimic swing flaws. Students may think they slice because of swing path when in fact they are aligned open to the target. Coaches should check shoulders, hips, and feet against the intended line. Ball position also matters: too far forward leads to thin shots, too far back can cause steep, fat contact. Small changes here often resolve big ball-flight problems.

## 5. Takeaway
The first move of the swing should be smooth and coordinated. Coaches should ensure the club, arms, and shoulders move together, with the clubhead staying outside the hands briefly before swinging up on plane. Overactive wrists or a sharp inside takeaway often create compensations later. A slow-motion rehearsal of the first two feet of the backswing helps ingrain the right path.

## 6. Backswing
At the top of the backswing, key checkpoints include a full shoulder turn, stable lower body, and square clubface. Coaches should avoid allowing the hands to lift vertically or the club to cross the line. A square clubface is neither wide open nor snapped shut; keeping it neutral simplifies the downswing. Students should aim for width in the backswing, extending the lead arm without locking it.

## 7. Transition and Sequencing
The change of direction from backswing to downswing is where many swings break down. Coaches should stress that the downswing starts with a bump of the hips toward the target, not a lunge of the shoulders. Proper sequencing—lower body first, torso second, arms last—creates lag and power. Rushing from the top is a common amateur error that leads to slices and pulls.

## 8. Downswing Path
On the way down, the club should approach from the inside, allowing for a square strike. Over-the-top moves, where the club cuts across the ball, usually stem from shoulders dominating the transition. Coaches can use drills such as placing an alignment stick outside the ball to train an inside path. Watching for early wrist release (casting) is also crucial; retaining angle until just before impact maximizes energy transfer.

## 9. Impact
Impact is the moment of truth. Coaches should emphasize hands slightly ahead of the clubhead, weight shifted to the lead side, and eyes steady. If students hit behind the ball, they may be hanging back or scooping; if they top shots, they may be standing up early. Reinforce a downward strike with irons and a sweeping motion with woods, always ensuring weight finishes forward.

## 10. Follow-Through
A balanced finish provides visible feedback on the entire motion. Students should rotate fully so their chest faces the target, with their weight entirely on the lead foot and the trail heel lifted. Coaches should encourage players to hold this finish for several seconds—if balance is off, it signals earlier flaws. The follow-through should feel natural, not forced, if the swing sequence is correct.

## 11. Tempo and Rhythm
Good swings share rhythm more than mechanics. Coaches should encourage a smooth, unhurried backswing followed by a confident downswing, often described as a 3:1 ratio in timing. Quick, jerky motions almost always lead to inconsistency. Rhythm drills—such as swinging while counting or practicing with music—can help players find a repeatable cadence that keeps their swing under control.

## 12. Common Faults and Fixes
Most issues trace back to the fundamentals. Slices result from weak grips and outside-in paths; hooks from strong grips and excessive inside paths. Fat shots come from poor weight transfer; thin shots from early extension. Rather than overloading students with technical jargon, coaches should link fixes to simple feels: stronger grip, better posture, smoother tempo, or fuller weight shift. By reinforcing basics and correcting one flaw at a time, coaches set students on a clear path to improvement.
